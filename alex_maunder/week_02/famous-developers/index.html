      <p>Frances Elizabeth "Fran" Allen (born August 4, 1932) is an American computer scientist and pioneer in the field of <a href="#optimizing_compilers">optimizing compilers.</a> Allen was the first female IBM Fellow and in 2006 became the first woman to win the Turing Award. Her achievements include seminal work in compilers, program optimization, and parallelization. Since 2002, she has been a Fellow Emerita from IBM.</p>
      <h3>Career and Research</h3>
      <p>Deeply in debt, she joined IBM Research in Poughkeepsie, NY, as a programmer in 1957, where she taught incoming employees the basics of Fortran. She planned to return to teaching once her student loans had been paid but ended up staying with IBM for her entire 45-year career.</p>
      <p>Allen was assigned to the Harvest project for code breaking with the National Security Agency in 1959 and worked on a programming language called Alpha. She managed the compiler-optimization team for both Harvest and the Stretch project. In the 1960s she contributed to the ACS-1 project and in the 1970s to PL/I. From 1970 to 1971 she spent a sabbatical at New York University and acted as adjunct professor for a few years afterwards. Another sabbatical brought her to Stanford University in 1977.</p>
      <p>Allen became the first female IBM Fellow in 1989.</p>
      <p>Allen was recognized for her work in high-performance computing with the 2006 Turing Award. She became the first woman recipient in the forty-year history of the award, which is considered the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for computing.</p>
      <h3>Fortran</h3>
      <p>Fortran (/ˈfɔːrtræn/; formerly FORTRAN, derived from Formula Translation) is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.</p>
      <p>It was developed by John W. Backus in 1957 and was the successor to "Assembly"; the first mnemonic-to-machine-code language. It was developed to integrate more effectively with IBM hardware and was the dominant programming language for scientific and engineering application for many years. It's design was the basis for many other programming languages including BASIC.</p>
      <h3 id="optimizing_compilers">Optimizing Compilers</h3>
      <p>What is a compiler?</p>
      <p>A compiler is a program that converts instructions into a machine-code or lower-level form so that they can be read and executed by a computer. It is a program that lets users create programming languages taht more closely resemble regular written words.</p>
      <p>In 1976, Fran collaborated with John Cocke on "Project Y". Later called the "Advanced Computing Systems project (ACS)", it included a set of cutting-edge advances in computer system design. The hardware might be described in today's terms as the first "superscalar" processor, where the CPU does not execute instructions one at a time (as in previous designs), but works on several instructions at once, perhaps even performing instructions "in the wrong order" to get the work done more quickly.</p>
      <p>Parallel Translator (PTRAN) - the IBM parallel translation system. Fran lead this project which allowed for the automatic parallel execution of FORTRAN programs.</p>
      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Fran Allen's focus has not been on inventing new programming languages or language features and then trying to get people to program using them. Rather, she focused on taking programs as programmers like to write them, and made them run efficiently by doing sophisticated analysis and optimization of the code. She didn’t create paper designs, but a series of working systems that run real programs, not just artificial benchmarks, faster. Today's programming language compilers still rely on techniques that she pioneered. </p>
