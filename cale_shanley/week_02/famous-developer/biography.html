        <p>
          <span>Matsumoto</span> (born 14 April 1965, 55 years), also known by
          many as <span>Matz</span>, is a Japanese computer scientist and
          software programmer best known as the chief designer of the Ruby
          programming language and its reference implementation. As of 2011,
          Matsumoto is the Chief Architect of Ruby at Heroku, an online cloud
          platform-as-a-service in San Francisco. He is a fellow of Rakuten

            <h2>What is Ruby Programming?</h2>
            <p>
              <span>Ruby</span> is a language of careful balance. Its creator,
              <span>Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto</span>, blended parts of his
              favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to
              form a new language that balanced functional programming with
              imperative programming. He has often said that he is “trying to
              make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.
              Building on this, he adds:
              <span class="italic">
                Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just
                like our human body.</span
