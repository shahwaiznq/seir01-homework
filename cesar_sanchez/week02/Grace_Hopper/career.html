              <p id='bio'>Hopper was born the 9th of December of 1906 in New York City. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar College in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.</p>

              <p id='wwii'>During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.</p>

              <p id='univac'>In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I. Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English."</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
              <p id='cobol'>In the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL. Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.</p>
