# # Calculator
#
# ### Explanation
# - You will be building a calculator.  A calculator can perform multiple arithmetic operations.  Your function should allow the user to choose which operation is expected, enter in the values to perform the operation on, and ultimately view the result.
#
# ## Mortgage Calculator
# Calculate the monthly required payment given the other variables as input (look up the necessary variables)
#
# ## BMI Calculator
# Calculate the body mass index (BMI) for an individual, given their height and weight
#
# ## Trip Calculator
# Calculate a trip time and cost given inputs for
# - distance
# - miles per gallon
# - price per gallon
# - speed in miles per hour
