        <h2>The Early Years of John Von Neumann</h2>
        <img src="img/JVNchild.jpg" alt="JVN as a young boy">
        <p>I was what they call a child prodigy. When I was six years old, I could divide two eight-digit numbers in my head and could speak in Ancient Greek. By the age of eight, I was familiar with differential and integral calculus. At the age of 15, I begun to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő. The first time we met, Gábor was so astounded with my mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. By the age of 19, I had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition.</p>
        <p>I liked to eat and drink. My wife, Klara, said that I could count everything except calories. I also enjoyed Yiddish and "off-color" humor (I loved limericks). In Princeton, I used to get complaints for playing my loud German marching music on my gramophone, It used to distract everyone in all the offices near mine, including old mate Albert Einstein (hahaha - sucker), from his work. I did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, and once told off my wife for preparing a quiet study for me to work in. I never used it, always preferred the living room with its television playing loudly.</p>
