          <h2>Career</h2>
            <img class="career" src="img/career.jpg" alt="Margaret was awarded">
            <p>In Boston, she initially intended to enroll in graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis. However, in the summer of 1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at MIT. She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC. Her work contributed to Lorenz's publications on chaos theory. At the time, computer science and software engineering were not yet established disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience. She moved on to another project in the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen Fetter as her replacement.</p>
